		Dog Obedience Training is good for you and your dog. Your dog is your companion and a member of
		your family, it is worth taking the time to learn how to better communicate with them. With
		consistent practice and the proper techniques you can establish the foundation for an obedient
		dog, which makes for a happy home.

		to showing, grooming to training and everything in between. She has taught numerous people how
		to work with their dogs, starting with beginners level all the way to advanced.

			We will meet once a week for one hour of class time. The class lasts for 8 weeks. You will
			need to practice with your dog for at least 30 minutes per day outside of class. The final
			class you and your dog will be tested to show standards. Once you have completed the class,
			you need to continue working with your dog every day, keep on practicing. You truly get out
			what you put into it.

			We will start with some basic obedience commands and practice working with our dogs to
			reinforce these skills throughout the class.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Heel</li>
			<li>Sit</li>
			<li>Stay</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			That will be our foundation, and we will build on that as we progress, yet always coming back
			to these basics. Short, frequent training sessions throughout the week are highly recommended.
